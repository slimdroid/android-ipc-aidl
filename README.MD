# Interaction Between Two Processes via AIDL Interface in Android

## Description

This application demonstrates the interaction between two processes in Android using the AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) interface. The application implements two processes that exchange data and perform certain tasks, showcasing an example of inter-process communication (IPC) in Android.

## Key Features

- **Inter-Process Communication:** The app demonstrates how to use AIDL to facilitate communication between two different processes.
- **Data Transmission:** Example of sending data from one process to another.
- **Data Reception:** Handling and receiving data from another process.
- **Data way keywords:** Explanation of keywords `in`, `out`, `inout` and `oneway`.
- **AIDL Implementation:** Implementation of the AIDL interface for IPC.

## Installation

1. Clone the application repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/slimdroid/android-ipc-aidl.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Synchronize the project with Gradle.
4. Run the application on an emulator or physical device.

## Conclusion

This application illustrates how to organize interaction between two processes in Android using AIDL. This implementation can be useful in projects requiring secure and efficient inter-process communication.
